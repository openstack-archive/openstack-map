      An OpenStack deployment contains a number of components providing
      APIs to access infrastructure resources. This page lists the various
      services that can be deployed to provide such resources to cloud
      end users.

              Zun provides an OpenStack API for launching and managing
              containers backed by different container technologies.
              Different from Magnum, Zun is for users who want to treat
              containers as OpenStack-managed resource. Containers managed
              by Zun are supposed to be integrated well with other OpenStack
              resources, such as Neutron network and Cinder volume. Users
              are provided a simplified APIs to manage containers without
              the need to explore the complexities of different container
              technologies.

              optimized for durability, availability, and concurrency across
              the entire data set. Swift is ideal for storing unstructured
              data that can grow without bound.

              without requiring any knowledge of where their storage is
              actually deployed or on what type of device. This is done through
              the use of either a reference implementation (LVM) or plugin
              drivers for other storage.

              Octavia is an open source, operator-scale load balancing solution
              designed to work with OpenStack. Octavia was borne out of the
              Neutron LBaaS project, and starting with the Liberty release of
              OpenStack, Octavia has become the reference implementation for
              Neutron LBaaS version 2. Octavia accomplishes its delivery of
              load balancing services by managing a fleet of virtual machines,
              containers, or bare metal servers —collectively known as
              amphorae— which it spins up on demand. This on-demand, horizontal
              scaling feature differentiates Octavia from other load balancing
              solutions, thereby making Octavia truly suited “for the cloud.”
