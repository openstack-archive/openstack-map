                Bifrost (pronounced bye-frost) is a set of Ansible playbooks
                that automates the task of deploying a base image onto a set of
                known hardware using ironic. It provides modular utility for
                one-off operating system deployment with as few operational
                requirements as reasonably possible.

                RPM Packaging for OpenStack is an cross-distribution and
                cross-vendor effort to create common templates for building
                OpenStack packages for RPM based Linux and OpenStack
                distributions. The project was started with the goal of
                unifying the independent packaging efforts of RDO and SUSE,
                but is really open for anyone who wants to contribute RPM
                packaging spec files for any distribution.
