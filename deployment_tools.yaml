                Bifrost (pronounced bye-frost) is a set of Ansible playbooks 
                that automates the task of deploying a base image onto a set of 
                known hardware using ironic. It provides modular utility for 
                one-off operating system deployment with as few operational 
                requirements as reasonably possible.
